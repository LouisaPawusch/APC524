# APC524 Final Project
Authors: Lara Tobias-Tarsh, Louisa Pawusch, Erin O'Neil

## Description
This repository contains the code for our APC524 Project (Fall 2025), creating a universal
cellular automata library for use in scientific modelling. The most basic implementation
of this is Conway's Game of Life, which is implemented first.
